     How to communicate using Pull Requests
---

We follow [https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/main/code-review](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/main/code-review) but here
we repeat for clarity

* Try to respond to every comment in 24h or at least in 48h
* After you ask for review, do not work on the branch for example force push new changes
* If you have multiple related PR, you can use single or multuple PR, but explain in comments what needs to be merged first
